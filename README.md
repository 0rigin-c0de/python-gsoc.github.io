Python's Google Summer of Code Site
===================================

For many years, Python has used wiki.python.org to keep track of ideas pages,
FAQs, schedules, and all the plans for our participation in Google Summer of
Code. Unfortunately, editing the wiki isn't easy for everyone: it requires a
separate account, explicit edit permissions, knowledge of somewhat arcane
syntax.  As a result, the wiki pages are maintained by a very small group.
Since we had great success with moving the GSoC contributor blog information to
github so people could use pull requests to update it, we're going to try to
do the same with the info pages and see how it works out.

You can view the live webpage at

Students: Read this!
====================

Please read [How to get started with
GSoC](https://python-gsoc.org/index.html#gettingstarted) first!

**This repo is a bad place to look for a first commit during GSoC.** This
website is not a valid GSoC project because there isn't enough code or changes
to employ a student for a few months.  You probably want to look at the issue
trackers for our sub-orgs if you're looking for a good first commit.  [You can
see the list of python sub-orgs here](https://python-gsoc.org/ideas.html) and
each one has their own website, issue tracker, getting started instructions and
so on.  Have fun!

If you're looking between September and February, be aware that the list of
sub-orgs may not be up to date for the next season of GSoC yet, and mentors may
be taking a well-deserved break.
